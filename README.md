Approach an animal from the trading list and interact with it while holding the correct item in your main hand to receive a special effect!

## Configuration

### Adjustable Settings

- **Sound Effects**: Enable or disable sounds during trades.
- **Particle Effects**: Choose whether to see particle effects.

## Changing Trades

Modify the configuration file to change trades, including the animal, required item, price,
<br>effect type, effect duration, and max effect duration. Experiment to create unique animal trades!
